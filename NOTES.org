* TODO Control tracks									      :FR:
Any controllable value can be turned into a control track.
Icon next to controllable values, drag'n'drop onto editor.

- should control tracks be measured?
  - if not, inserting a new measure across all tracks becomes non-obvious
  - if not, layouting needs to be reimplemented
    - each track has its own layout
    - but measures should still align
  - control tracks should still be rendered as a sequence of measures,
    aligned to the other tracks
  - if yes, moving control points across measure boundaries becomes
    non-trivial
- what happens when the song becomes shorter than a control track?
  - discard all control points past the end
    - clip last segment correctly?
  - or keep control points, but just don't show them
  - or keep track length
- splines?
- free hand
- properties
  - min/max
  - linear/log
  - unit (Hz, dB, %, ..)
- display current value under cursor position
- edit track properties
- implicit first and last segment
  - extend current value from start or end
- ControlEntitySource: compute value at a-rate

* TODO ToolDock: track specific tool set						      :FR:
- active track:
  only the active track gets edit events. clicking on another track makes
  that track active and changes the set of tools and the active tool.
- remember active tool per track type
- could also activate track by enter events
  - but if mouse then moves to tracks dock, it might cross other tracks causing confusion

* TODO Fixed horizontal time mapping							      :FR:
- Same horizontal interval maps to same musical time interval anywhere.
  Otherwise rendering control segments across measure boundaries becomes very confusing.
- ScoreMeasure has to fit into given space no matter what.
- Zooming along time axis.

* turn any node parameter into a control input port					      :FR:
- ports can be added and removed on the fly
- parameter description has sufficient data to describe port
- parameter is always a-rate in csound

* Exception when closing a project 							     :BUG:
- 'dict_values' object is not an iterator
- no traceback?

* Abstract base class for ui mixins							 :CLEANUP:
- to make pylint happy

* Revamp object model									 :CLEANUP:
- root manages heap of objects
- when creating object, add it to heap
  - __init__ needs to know root, so it can create children
  - or separate setup() method?
- all object references (child, lists, etc.) only store IDs in state, do
  lazy dereferencing on __get__

* Fully replace obsolete node descriptions						 :CLEANUP:
* Track type: percussion								      :FR:
** move beats to arbitrary positions
* Sometimes hangs during shutdown							     :BUG:
Last sign of life:
  INFO    :18195:7f91c16bc700:ui.editor_app: Shutting down.

* Custom csound filter node								      :FR:
- make port list editable
- report csound errors back to UI
- two engines - new/old code - in parallel, slide from old to new
  - init new code
  - start processing new code , output at 0
  - slide old=100%, new=0% -> old=0%, new=100%
  - stop processing old code
  - clean up old code
  - how does that work with arbitrary output nodes? and events?
- edit widget with syntax highlighting
- add to library
  - editing inproject only changes local state
  - explicit sync to library?
  - any filter can be saved in library as a "preset"
* merge consecutive commands								      :FR:
- keep a single item in-memory buffer before writing commands to disk
- when adding commands to log
  - call prev_cmd.try_merge_with(latest_cmd)
    - command class must be marked as mergable
    - if same class, append mutation log of latest_cmd to prev_cmd?
    - or just handle simple attribute changes, overwriting the target value
  - if returns False, push latest_cmd to log (flushing prev_cmd to disk)

* per measure time signature								      :FR:
Tracks can have different time signatures, measures do not have to align
vertically.
* replace SheetPropertyTrack by a controllable parameter				      :FR:
* SIGSEGV when editing PipelineGraphView						   :CRASH:
Possibly caused by the use of QGraphicsEffect for dropshadows?

* PipelineGraphView: node properties dock sometimes does not open.			     :BUG:
Dock shortly pops up, then disappears. Clicking on any other widget in
the docking area then SIGSEGVs. Does QT not like opening docks directly
as floating? There might have been a X11 error message in the log.

* GIL free audio pipeline								      :FR:
* Plugin support									      :FR:
** LADSPA
** LV2
* Render audio to file									      :FR:

* PipelineGraphView: edit node name							      :FR:
* Track volume/mute properties: change connect trackmixer node instead.			     :BUG:
* Color code tracks and measures.							      :FR:
Tracks: To group e.g. all percussion visually.
Measures: To group thematically related sections.
Popup menu provides palette of color, separate list of already used colors
(to make it easier to answer the question, which shade of green I used
before).

* Linked measures									      :FR:
Dereference: clone the pointed to measure and replace link with that copy.
If a group of linked measures is selected, only make one copy and link the
rest. E.g. A B A' B' [A' B' A' B'] -> A B A' B' C D C' D', where C=copy(A),
D=copy(B).
Explicit dereference all to create standalone clone for every selected
measure.

* PipelineGraphView: drop onto existing node to replace it.				      :FR:
Retain properties of the same name from replaced node.
Deny drop, if node is not compatible with existing node.
* PipelineGraphView: drop new node on connection.					      :FR:
Insert node between the connected nodes.
Deny drop, if node is not compatible with connection type.
Reorganize graph to make space for the new node.

** Way to select all upstream nodes of a node.
** Move nodes together.
** Remove all
* PipelineGraphView: visualize mute, volume, bypass state in UI				      :FR:

* More instrument types									      :FR:
- simple samples
- SFZ

* Audio tracks										      :FR:
- keep separate list of audio clips
- drag'n'drop sections onto audio tracks
- a section is a clip or range of a clip
- per section envelope
  - short (few msec) ramp up/down to avoid clicks
* cut, copy, paste									      :FR:
- Use QClipboard
- select multiple items
  - ranges or sparse sets

  - mutually exclusive
    - when a different type is selected, clear selection
  - measures
  - tracks

- EditorWindow has a single object currently being the "action receivers"
  - use Qt focus?

* UI state vs. project state
   * UI state:
      * current sheet, track, etc.
      * selections
      * position in view, zoom level, etc.
   * there could be multiple UIs for a project
   * same UI state spans projects
      * window/dock positions, sizes
   * project mutations might affect UI state
      * selected track is removed, etc.
      * undo should recreate related UI state changes
         * undo delete current track -> re-added track becomes current
* cli:
   * subcommands 
      * edit path
      * create path

* CLEANUP: Use state pattern to handle tools
* UI: show on cursor when an operation is not allowed
* UI: press ‘h’ to highlight all locations where the current tool is applicable
* ties/slurs:
   * either: note groups or markers
   * markers:
      * begin, continue, end
      * adding begin/continue marker, adds end marker to next note
      * continue/end marker implies prev note has begin/continue marker
      * note can have multiple markers
         * A(b) B(c,b) C(e,c) D(e):
  
         * should markers have some group_id to identify which slur they belong to?
         * would it be sufficient to just list the group_ids for each slur that a note belongs to? if it’s the beginning/middle/end could be deduced. but that knowledge is handy for rendering and playback
   * groups:
   * track wide list of groups
   * add notes to groups
   * notes have reference to groups
   * find other notes in group requires cyclic references
   * edit flows:
   * click on note that is currently ‘end’
   * becomes ‘continue’, next note becomes ‘end’
   * click on note before ‘begin’
   * becomes ‘begin’, next note becomes ‘continue’
   * click on note that is currently ‘begin’, ‘continue’
